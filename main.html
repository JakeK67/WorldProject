    <h2>Cruelty In The East</h2>
    <p>
      As the war has dragged on, Japanese brutality has increased to highs never seen before;
      insofar to the lab benches, where countless innocent civilians are experimented on with increasingly cruel and unusual methods. 
      This abuse is especially prominent in Japan's "Unit 731," located in Pingfan district China, where human experiments that rival that of Josef Mengele take place. 
      Naturally, since Unit 731's headquarters are located within China, many of the subjects are of Chinese nationality; 
      however, many Russians, Koreans, and other prisoners of war were experimented on too; all of the victims are referred to as "maruta," or "logs" by the staff. 
      These experiments—similar to ones conducted within Nazi Germany—are performed sans anesthesia, so as to not skew the results of the barbaric experiments. 
      Experiments include the vivisections of live civilians, as to learn the value of varying organs; the injection of incurable diseases, as to learn the live effects of disease on the human body; 
      and a plethora of other examples. In these experiments, the majority of subjects died an excruciating death. 
      Even now, many victims are still seeking closure, as the Japanese government continues to stay opaque.
